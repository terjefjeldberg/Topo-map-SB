# IFC Hierarchy Widget Starter

This is a standalone starter for exploring IFC hierarchy in StreamBIM.

## Files

- `index.html`: Basic UI shell and bootstrap.
- `hierarchy-api.js`: API adapter and capability probing.
- `hierarchy-store.js`: State container with lazy child loading.
- `hierarchy-view.js`: Tree renderer and UI bindings.

## Goals

- Render `Project > Site > Building > Storey > Element`.
- Lazy load children on expand.
- Fall back cleanly when true IFC containment is not exposed by API.

## Notes

- This starter is intentionally conservative: it does not assume private backend endpoints.
- If your project exposes IFC hierarchy endpoints via `makeApiRequest(...)`, wire them in `hierarchy-api.js`.
- If only flat object APIs are available, this widget will show project/building/storey where possible and mark missing levels clearly.
